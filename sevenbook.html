            <h1>7 Books About The Vietnam War You Should Know About</h1>
            <p>
            My list of seven must-read books about the Vietnam war, a tragic that had shaped Vietnam and the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, a century with “loads of bombs but few flowers”, as a Vietnamese poet wrote.

                <h2>1. The Sympathizer</h2>
                <p>By Viet Thanh Nguyen</p>

                <p>Challenged the precedented that a book about the Vietnam war should be written by a white veteran man, and a Vietnamese immigrant’s book needs to mention the American dream and how it transformed their live, Viet Thanh Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant who came to the U.S after the turbulent event of 1975, had to bring his book to 14 publishers for it to finally got published.
                </p>
                <p>The book won the Pulitzer prize in 2016 for the fiction category, a success exceeding Nguyen’s wildest expectations, as he mentioned in several interviews.
                </p>
                <p>Philip Caputo, in a NYT’s book review, stated that the book gave “the voice to the previously voiceless” and had people looking at the war in a new light. Moreover, the novel reached “beyond its historical context to illuminate more universal themes: the eternal misconceptions and misunderstandings between East and West, and the moral dilemma faced by people forced to choose not between right and wrong, but right and right.”

                <p>Similar to Viet Thanh Nguyen’s case, Hanoi’s War by Lien-Hang T. Nguyen is one of those rare books about the Vietnam war actually written by Vietnamese, even though they are both Vietnamese Americans, who were born in Vietnam, but were raised in the U.S.
                Their roots, however, still gave them insiders' viewpoints more than outsiders.
                </p>
                <p>As one of a few people, including Vietnamese scholars, who got access to the Ministry of Foreign Affair’s archive, Nguyen’s book gave the readers a better understanding of who was behind Hanoi’s war strategy and the hidden fights among North Vietnam’s top leaders.

                <h2>3. Embers of War</h2>
                <p>By Fredrik Logevall</p>

                <p>An impressive book about Vietnam from a person who has spent nearly 30 years studying about the war.</p>
                <p>With “Embers of War,” Frederik Logevall went back to several decades before the U.S. officially involved in the war, to shed light on the relationship that shouldn't have to be so tragic - costing the lives of millions of Vietnamese and more than 58,000 Americans.
                </p>
                <p>Logevall pointed out that the leader of the Vietnamese revolution, Ho Chi Minh, had approached US President Woodrow Wilson in the 1930s to ask the U.S. to support Vietnam's desire to gain independence from the French colonialists; that the war might have been avoided had Franklin Roosevelt, who recognized that European colonialism threatened world peace, had not died in 1945; or getting deeper into the war, the Americans made the same mistakes that the French made before.
                </p>
                <p>Bernard Fall — a prestigious scholar on Vietnam, was quoted that the Americans “dreaming different dreams than the French but walking in the same footsteps.”
                Logevall also said that, while Americans may like to think that they entered the war in Vietnam on a humanitarian mission to keep Indo-China from falling into communist hands, colonialism is often in the eyes of the beholder.

                <p>My top favorite book about the Vietnam war with tons of information from an insider who worked as a special assistant for the special assistant of the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. The U.S. government was lying to the public about the war. And the public didn’t care enough. And the tragedy happened.
                </p>
                <p>The book is on my list mainly because it shows people’s bravery and commitment to upholding democracy’s core values. The world might be so different, and there might be hundreds of thousands of people more to die if Daniel Ellsberg, the author, didn’t care about exposing 7,000 pages of confidential papers that showed that the U.S. government was lying about the war in the case famously known as “the Pentagon Papers.”

                <p>A very detailed account from Henry Kissinger - the Secretary of State at that time, about the process of America’s withdrawal from Vietnam and the negotiations to end the war in honor for the Americans. A truly insider’s point of view, however, should be read with care.
                </p>
                <p>Kissinger himself wrote that the book is "A balanced judgment on Vietnam continues to elude us--and therefore the ability to draw lessons from a national tragedy which America inflicted on itself," and "As a result, Vietnam has become the black hole of American historical memory."
                </p>
                <p>He also drew one of the important lessons learned from the war was “the importance of absolute honesty and objectivity in all reporting, within and from the government as well as from the press."
